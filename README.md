TableViewCellWithAutoLayout
===========================

*Note: This sample project requires __Xcode 5__ and __iOS 7__ or later. For a sample project demonstrating the self-sizing cell functionality added and available in iOS 8 only, [click here](https://github.com/smileyborg/TableViewCellWithAutoLayoutiOS8).*

Sample project demonstrating manual implementation of auto sizing cells using Auto Layout in UITableViewCell to achieve dynamic layouts with variable row heights. This project is a universal app that will run on iPhone and iPad. This implementation is compatible with both iOS 7 and iOS 8.

This sample project displays a table view with cells that each contain a single-line title label and a multi-line body label (each cell's body label displays a random number of lorem ipsum words).

This project utilizes the open source [PureLayout](https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout) library to easily set up constraints in code.
